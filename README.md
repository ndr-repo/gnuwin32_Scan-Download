# Description

Created by Gabriel H. [@weekndr_sec](https://github.com/ndr-repo)

This is an installation tool that scans GnuWin32 SourceForge URLs, shows the results, then prompts for approval to proceed with downloading and running the file.

Currently, the tool is configured to install:
- awk
- gawk
- grep
- sed
  
# Why?

I did this because the original website does not have a ZIP of all the tools. Some of the links dont work anymore, so I added the scanning feature utilizing Alienvault's free API. No key needed.
